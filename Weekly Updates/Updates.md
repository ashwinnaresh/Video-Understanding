# Video Understanding - Weekly Updates

This document contains the weekly updates on the video understanding project for the MIIS Capstone requirement.

## Work done since the final presentation in May

An initial topic analysis of the videos in the How-To dataset was done using the video transcriptions. The dominant topics of the videos were Health, Yoga, Cooking, Stitching to name a few.
