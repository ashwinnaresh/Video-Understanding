# Video Understanding - Weekly Updates

This document contains the weekly updates on the video understanding project for the MIIS Capstone requirement.

## Work done since the final presentation in May

An initial topic analysis of the videos in the How-To dataset was done using the video transcriptions. The dominant topics of the videos were Health, Yoga, Cooking, Stitching to name a few.

------ | ------- | ----------------
Arvind | <ul><li>Try content F1 score and other content similarity measures (METEOR/ ROUGE) to get better distinction between similar and dissimilar videos - Content F1 score is not in any literature. New metric defined, which is a modification of METEOR. Need more understanding before using it</li><li>Identify main sets of topics to focus on for initial evaluation - Relationships, Yoga, Excercise were the major topics</li><li>Improve the interpretibility of the different techniques by juxtaposing the results appropriately. - Made a simple UI for comparing different ranking mechanisms</li><li>Stretch goals: <ul><li>Design model for difference generation - Siamese network with a probable heirarchical attention mechanism. Evaluating NMTPytorch for building the seq2seq model.</li></li></ul> | <ul><li>Implement the initial model in NMTPy</li><li>Train the above model on Yoga videos</li><li>Stretch goals: <ul><li>Try MMR based dissimilar sentence retrieval.<li>Perform error analysis on the summaries generated</li></li></li></ul>
Ashwin | <ul><li>Implement model and train for difference generation (on dummy data atleast) - Model has been implemented; it is a siamese seq2seq model with 3-way tied encoders and 2 decoders. The end to end network optimizes the cross entropy loss and there is an auxiliary triplet loss at the encoder.  Gradients explode for some of the training batches randomly leading to NaN loss values; Working on fixing this issue</li><li>Experiment with object and scene features for summarization - Script to extract the object and place features (imagenet and places CNN) is ready and tested on a small sample. There is a storage constraint on the cluster to save these features.
